For the past year, Rand had been working on robotics projects with his peer. Rand worked on such projects because he would find immense satisfaction in building something from scratch. Even though he spent countless hours on such projects researching, building, failing, testing etc. he still wanted to so more in this field. Seeing the amazing stuff people do out there, he wanted to be one of them. With that he ended his chain of thought and resumed working on the pile of HW he had.
